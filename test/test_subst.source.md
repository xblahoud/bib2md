Hello,

this is a markdown file that uses the `\mdcite` command like this:
I should read the \mdcite{babiak.15.cav}

What about $`2^n`$ math? And block?

$$
a^b \times c
$$

$$
c \cdot d = d \cdot c
$$

and we would like to cite again here \mdcite{blahoudek.17.lpar}

and \mdcite{babiak.15.cav} again.

And how does a \cite{babiak.15.cav} look like?
